The instruction set can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-349-06978-1%2F1.pdf), if no longer available (you are in the future) please search 8085 instruction set on the popular search engine. I used Google Search. 


Going through the instruction set will really get you to understand the MPU.

For example, by going through the Arithmetic Instructions , I found out that the Memory locations can be specified by using H & L registers. This means the 8085 is a von Neumann architecture based.

:D Please enjoy the Assembly language.
